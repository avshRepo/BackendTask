instructions:
1. first clone the project to your computer
2. open the project in inteliji
3. setup the scala sdk to 2.11.8
4. create Play2App configuration
5. run the configuration
6. in the browser play will run on http://localhost:9000
7. for event types count go to http://localhost:9000/eventsCount
8. for word count go to http://localhost:9000/wordsCount


3 things I would improve in my submission:
1. I would use ElasticSearch and store the logs in it
2. I would use Kafka instead of saving the data at Map
3. I would change the mutable map i used to immutable map in order to make my code more functional
