3. in the browser play will run on http://localhost:9000
4. for event types count go to http://localhost:9000/eventsCount

3 things I would improve in my submission:
1. I would use ElasticSearch and store the logs in it
2. I would use Kafka instead of saving the data at Map
3. I would change the mutable map i used to immutable map in order to make my code more functional
